    "2": "2 How To Use Welcome to the WVEMS Protocols 2020! • Think of this like a tool box, not a cookbook. • You should use several protocols at the same time on every call. • You may use any intervention marked for your level or lower. Basic procedures are assumed for every call. • Don’t forget: scene safe, BSI, ABC’s, call for ALS, notify the ED, etc. • Every patient should have a full assessment including vital signs. • Ask about medical allergies and pregnancy before giving meds. Call for online Medical Direction at any time for advice on: • Any questions, problems, or if uncertain for any reason. • Getting permission to deviate from these protocols. • If unable to contact, remember: Get the patient to the hospital. Protocols mean you can, but not always that you should. • Use only enough to stabilize and/or improve. Don’t follow blindly. • Skip anything unnecessary. Not every box need to be completed. • The listed order suggests importance, but is not absolute. Severity is a subjective judgement that requires thought. • Not all decisions are black and white. Use this text as a guide. • Reassess and restart protocols as needed during a call. • Use good clinical sense to decide what takes precedence. Presume routine things when appropriate, like: • SpO2, EKG, EtCO2, glucometer, phlebotomy, etc. • Regular layperson first aid treatments like splinting & band-aids. • Note: protocols may also include reminders (like “12-Lead”). Pediatric considerations are included in every protocol. • Patients 13 y/o and over (13+) are generally given adult therapy. • Children (1-12) and Infants ( <1) are considered peds. • Use Peds Reference or other approved source for peds dosing. Critical Care is for credentialed paramedics only. • Provider’s responsibility to maintain mandatory prerequisites. • Must be approved for that specific protocol by the agency OMD. Reviewed: Dec 2020 • All deadlines expire on the last day of the month (grace period). References are included. This text is not comprehensive. • Medications may appear as brand name® or generic.

Abuse may be at the hand of a partner, parent, caregiver, spouse, neighbor, or adult child of the patient. The recognition, appropriate reporting, and referral of abuse is a critical step to improving patient safety, providing quality health care, and preventing further abuse. This also ensures EMS compliance as Mandatory Reporters under the Code of Virginia. • Be aware of the potential for abuse in all patients. In any case where abuse is suspected, first protect the patient and the EMS team from harm. Collect as much information as possible and preserve physical evidence if able. Signs of abuse may include: - Physical: injuries that are inconsistent with the reported mechanism, injuries in different stages of healing, defensive injuries (e.g. to forearms), or injuries during pregnancy - Psychological: excessive passivity, compliant / fearful behavior, excessive aggression, violent tendencies, excessive crying, behavioral disorders, substance abuse, or med non-compliance - Neglect: inappropriate level of clothing for weather, inadequate hygiene, inattentive caregiver, or malnutrition • Immediately report any suspicious findings to both the receiving hospital (if transported) and social services: - For children contact Child Protective Services at (800) 552-7096. - For adults contact Adult Protective Services at (888) 832-3858. - For domestic violence offer police intervention and provide the patient with the National Hotline, 1-800-799-SAFE.

Occasionally, bystanders may be crucial to providing or assisting with treatment. Bystanders can be considered when the immediate needs outweigh the EMS resources available, or if a bystander can provide a unique resource. EMS should never authorize or perform any intervention outside their scope or comfort level. • Bystanders may have a unique understanding of a specialized medical device or condition. EMS should consider the advice of patients or bystanders, such as caretakers managing a vent at home, or a patient with an LVAD, etc. EMS must call Medical Control for any orders to deviate from routine EMS care. • BLS procedures are frequently taught as a component of common first aid. Appropriate bystanders may assist with common first aid when EMS resources are insufficient. EMS must direct bystanders and maintain overall responsibility. • ALS interventions are only appropriate by responding ALS resources. A formal mutual aid agreement or authorization by Medical Control must exist prior to delivery of ALS interventions. EMS has no authority to enable non-EMS medical personnel (RN, NP, PA, CRNA, RT, etc.) to perform ALS interventions. Physician Orders • Physicians represent a unique resource.

Begin resuscitation and call Medical Control if there is any question. EMS may stop resuscitation once verified.
